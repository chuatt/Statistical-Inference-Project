# Overview
This is a document for Coursera Statistical Inference Course Final Project. This project will investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. Given that lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. 

Part 1 of the project will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials over a thousand simulations.

For the second part of the project, we are going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.
